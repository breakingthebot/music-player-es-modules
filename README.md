# Modular Music Player

A browser-based music player built with native ES modules, modular JavaScript files, and no bundler.

## Stack
- HTML5 and CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript with native ES modules
- Node.js for the local static server and test runner
- Playwright for browser interaction testing

## Setup
1. Install Node.js 22 or newer.
2. Clone the repository.
3. From the project root, run `node server.js`.
4. Open the local URL printed in the terminal.

## Environment Variables
This project does not currently require environment variables.
See `.env.example` for the canonical placeholder.

## Running Locally
- Start the app: `node server.js`
- Run the test suite: `node --test`
- Run the browser interaction test: `npm run test:browser`
- Run the combined CI-equivalent checks: `npm run test:ci`

## Deployed
Not deployed in this iteration.

## Architecture Notes
This iteration adds an explicit up-next queue without turning the player into a monolith. The controller now owns a lightweight queue state alongside the existing selected track, favorites, recents, search filters, sort mode, and resume data, while playback order stays predictable: queued tracks are consumed first, then the normal playlist order resumes. That keeps queue behavior easy to reason about and test because it is isolated from playlist rendering and from persistent preferences.

On the UI side, the playlist now exposes a dedicated `Play next` action per row and a separate queue panel shows what will play next and lets users remove items before they are consumed. Splitting that queue panel into its own renderer keeps the view layer modular and makes the new feature feel visible instead of hidden behind controller state.

## Notes
- Sample audio streams are loaded over HTTPS from SoundHelix for local demo playback.
- The local server is dependency-free so the project can run from a fresh clone without package installation.
- Player preferences are saved in `localStorage` under a single project-specific key.
- Playlist search matches against both track title and artist text.
- Favorite tracks are persisted locally and can be filtered as their own playlist view.
- Recently played tracks are persisted locally in a bounded, de-duplicated history.
- Track playback position is persisted per track so recent items can resume from their saved timestamp.
- GitHub Actions runs both unit tests and a Playwright browser interaction test on pushes and pull requests.
- Playlist sort mode is persisted locally and keyboard navigation now supports Arrow, Home, and End movement across playlist and recent rows.
- The up-next queue is intentionally session-only in this iteration so queue interactions stay simple while playback order rules are being established.
